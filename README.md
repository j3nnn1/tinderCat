This is a repo to keep organize a side project using the cat api https://thecatapi.com/ and keep learning about animations, angular 2, and Material angular 

CatCards have:
==========

- vote for a cat
- upload a cat image
- get Random cats for voting.

May be soon:
==========

- list votings
- list uploaded images
- descriptions about a cat 
- deleting images.
- deleting votes.
- pass to environment vars parameters like url, key, and others things.


Thanks to:
